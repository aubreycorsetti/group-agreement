  > Aubrey- Great with CSS, okay with JS!

2. How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?

  > Tim- wants a better strength in JS

4. Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?

> We can help eachother get better learning our code by breaking off into groups of two with others who have opposite strengths than us so we may better understand the process and logic of our code.

### Conflict Plan

1. What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?

  > Regroup, maintain growth mindset, take a small break and breath. If we can't come to an agreement then we will have a group vote. If the vote splits even, we will do a high-low roll and decide from there.

2. What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?

  > Regroup and have a conversation/ intervention expressing concern.

3. How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

  > MOTTO: We are only as strong as our weakest link.
  > Everyone has something to offer and something to learn. Being in groups will help our learning process. You are more knowledgeable than you realize.

4. How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?

  > Check on their mental state, make sure they are following along and address any questions they have.

5. How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?

  > If we have regrouped on the same topic multiple times, ask for an outsider opinion. If foul verbiage is used take a 10 minute break.

### Communication Plan

1. What hours will you be available to communicate?

  > We will maintain open communication throughout the day unless we are sleeping.

2. What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?

  > We will use Slack, Remo and personal phone numbers.

3. How often will you take breaks?

  > As needed, we are all adults and we can walk away for our own mental sake.

4. What is your plan if you start to fall behind?

  > 15 minute rule, reach out to other team members, teacher or TA

5. How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?

  > We will use Slack, Remo and personal phone numbers.

6. What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?

  > Do a round robin, go around the table and have each person speak on the topic.

7. How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?

  > Be respectful
  > Regroup once every hour or two to make sure we are all on the same page and supporting eachother properly
  > Lift eachother up and comment on parts of their ideas/input that we like
  > Maintain an open mind/growth mindset
  > Have fun!

### Work Plan

1. How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?

  > Assign tasks in our project and comment out each task/who/timing is incharge of that task where that task is to be performed.

2. What project management tool will be used?

  > GitHub's Project Manager

### Git Process

1. What components of your project will live on GitHub?

  > All of it except for the local storage.

2. How will you share the repository with your teammates?

  > Invite them as collaborators on our project.

3. What is your Git flow?

  > Create repository- have your main- create 1 branches off from your main- one of those two will be our working branch- when an individual works on a specific item they will branch from our working branch to their branch named for that project - when they are finshed they will send a pull request that needs 2 approvals to be merged with our working branch- once we have a mvp we can merge that onto main.

4. Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:

  * How many people must review a PR?
    > 2 people
  * Who merges PRs?
    > The group member who created the original repo
  * How often will you merge?
    > Every time we get a portion of the project completed and working.
  * How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?
    > regroup- get confirmation of one of the completed tasks. Ping people in slack, remo, phone to review the changes.
